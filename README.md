# Getting Started 

This is my React Front end to the HMCTS Code Challenge Tasks Management App

## Set up

Clone the Repository and run `npm install`


## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
it should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

There are only limited tests as I ran out of time, and also a module import error

I have created and tested a DemoComponent to show how it shoulld work
